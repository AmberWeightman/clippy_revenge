Clippy 2: Revenge of the Clip
================================

Have you ever been browsing the web and thought to yourself: "This is too easy and completely not something I need help with... If only I had Clippy while browsing the web to try to help me!" 

Neither have I. But here it is anyway.

* Does clippy do anything useful? No.

* Is he condescending for no reason? Yes.

* Is the plugin performant or optomized in any way? Of course not.

Finally, Clippy for chrome!


Special Thanks
================================
To the fine people at Smore (http://www.smore.com/) who made clippy.js, which I went and hacked for my own purposes.
